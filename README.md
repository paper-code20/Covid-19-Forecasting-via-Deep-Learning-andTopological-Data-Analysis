This package includes the source codes and datasets used in this research project. We encourage the reader to review the submitted paper: Covid-19 Forecasting via Deep Learning and Topological Data Analysis, and its Supplementary material.




* **ChangeFormat_Hospitalizations_XXXX.R**: These Scripts change the original format of county for each state data to our own format for the deep learning model.
* **LSTM_TDA_California_XXXX.py**: This code fit a LSTM oCovid data.
* **ExtractWeekly_Features_Washington**:  This Script changes the original format of county for each state data to our own format for the deep learning model.
