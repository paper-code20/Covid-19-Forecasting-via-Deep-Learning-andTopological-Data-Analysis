# Covid-19 Forecasting via Deep Learning and Topological Data Analysis

Our source code was developed using the following list of software:

* **Python**:  We use python 3.7.5 in several source codes, also we have tested such scripts in the latest python version 3.8.3. We only use common libraries such as NumPy, matplotlib, datetime, Keras,mean_squared_error, and mean_squared_error. . 

* **R**: We used basic R programming function like matrix,mean etc mostly for data transformation and dataset generation as per the model's requirements..
